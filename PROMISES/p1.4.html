/*
Synchronous API Calls:
- In synchronous calls, the program execution is blocked until the API call is complete.
- The code will wait for the API response before moving on to the next line of code.
- Traditional synchronous calls can potentially lead to a slower user experience, especially in web applications,
  as the entire program halts until the API request is finished.
- Synchronous calls are generally discouraged in web development because they can make your application unresponsive, 
  especially in the context of browser-based JavaScript.

Asynchronous API Calls:
- In asynchronous calls, the program continues to run while the API call is being made, and the response is 
  processed when it's ready.
- This approach is more common in modern JavaScript and web development, as it allows for a more responsive user 
  interface.
- Asynchronous calls typically use callbacks, Promises, or the more recent async/await syntax.
- Asynchronous calls are generally preferred in modern JavaScript development, especially in scenarios where 
  responsiveness and user experience are crucial, such as web applications.
